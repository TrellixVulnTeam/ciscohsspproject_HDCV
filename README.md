Cisco High School Shadow Program Project

----------------------------------------

main.py creates a Hello World web app using Flask and displays "Hello World!" when you open the local URL. If you add a '/example.html' to the URL, the file example.html displays.

vis_network.py accesses a csv file in the data folder and then creates a graph using the NetworkX and PyVis modules. It creates the html file for the network. main.py accesses the html file created and displays it.

venv is a virtual environment for testing the app.

----------------------------------------

Things To Do:
- Use our own sample data to create our own network
- Outline the process for creating this project (to be used in the presentation)
- Improve the project as we go along
